# Default It (React)

When you define propTypes for your component you will probably want to write defaultProps. Sometime it's very annoying...

```javascript
MyComponent.defaultProps = {
  someString: '',
  someFunction: () => {},
  someNumber: 0,
  /// etc
}
```

And... **Default It** can help you with it! Just select your propTypes and run *"Generate defaultProps"*!
